The fattoush was almost perfect, could have just been slightly fresher. Fatayer were not the best. Batatas Harras was excellent the best I have had in many years as most Lebanese places in London overdo the spices and end up with more like Bombay potatoes.

The food was only so-so: kind of bland. We ordered a pizza with sausage, but the \"sausage\" was more like a sliced hot dog than real Italian sausage. The wings were pretty good: meaty and well-cooked; although the barbecue sauce came just in a fast-food takeaway container, so the wings by themselves were bland.My driver was so upset with the long wait he had to endure at the restaurant (which made him late delivering my food to me) that he recommended I ask for a refund from Just Eat. He was so upset that he refused to accept the tip I tried to give him.

Now here ate where it starts going downhill, the garlic bread is not garlic bread at all I could get better in iceland its dry got and extremely chewy wouldnt get to be honest. Now im going to mention two items as they was both as bad as each other. If you fancy getting yourself some onion rings or mozerella sticks? Don't this is the worst I have ever had. You couldnt even cook them properly they were severly undercooked and i had to chuck them away the mozerella sticks were better but still had to be chucked away. The wings not really much to say about them to be honest Its just standard the usual and chicken dippers well they are nice to be honest but again standard just with a spicy kick. Overall though it wasnt too bad I dont think I will order here again but if I do it will just be Pizza only maybe chicken dippers, other than that though no. It was my first time ordeting with you guys and given the reviews I was expecting more but you never gave. I cant fault you on everything though as the delivery time was acgually good just 10 mins late thats fine given traffic ect. Overall 5/10 decent", "rating": "40"},

I can't ascertain whether the order was ready and the restaurant was waiting for the delivery driver to pick up. The app only indicates that the driver has not arrived yet. The driver called my mobile as I requested when he arrived.Please can the restaurant work with the Just Eat app and update the ordering interface. I selected the 4 x Flaming Volcano Milk Tea and if you read the description underneath the picture and the price at 4.45 you think that you have that as described. However, after selecting apart from customising the ice level you have to manually select the boba (even though the description and picture has the boba) and annoyingly the jasmine tea option although the summary name of my order is already Flaming Volcano Milk Tea. I didn't select Jasmine Tea option as I thought that was just an alternative tea and ended up with 4 x brown sugar boba milk which is not what I wanted.I've got back into the app selected the boba milk option and the interface is the same as the milk tea with the option to select Jasmine Tea. This is confusing and lazy and should be corrected.The boba was of poor quality. The milk was of good quality and it was still cold enough after the half hour delay and additional one hour travel time home. For those who like brown sugar milk this was ok but the boba itself was not.I would look forward to improvements to the ordering interface.", "rating": "20"},

The packaging is great and the desserts look lovely and just as advertised. I have ordered pancakes, waffles and chocolate lava cake and they were quite delicious. However, they need to tweak their recipe because the pancakes and waffles tasted a little floury. I was also disappointed when I ordered the strawberries with melted chocolate and received a strawberry milkshake instead (they are both the same price of 5.95 I think). When I called (because I thought I had been sent someone else's order) the man I spoke with was rather rude and said that I should have left a note clarifying that I wanted the strawberries with melted chocolate because when he receives the ticket order it only says strawberry. I fail to understand how that is my problem or how I could have possibly known this! If you (Milkman) know that there is a ticket clarification issue then add more information on the system so you can differentiate between customers wanting a strawberry milkshake or strawberries with melted chocolate! Or you could have called me and asked! The excuse was poor, the man was rude and I didn't appreciate him trying to put the blame on me.

My utter disappointment was further comDollarsed when I didn't receive a full refund, they still kept the service charge. It wasn't a large amount but it's the principal.
